Jiahao JI is a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, China, supervised by Prof. [Jingyuan Wang](https://www.bigscity.com/). In February 2021, he participated in the joint doctoral training program of [JD Intelligent Cities Research](https://icity.jd.com/research/home), supervised by Prof. [Yu Zheng](http://urban-computing.com/yuzheng) and Dr. [Junbo Zhang](https://zhangjunbo.org/). He received his B.S from Beihang University in 2019. He will start another joint doctoral training program of [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg), Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Cheng Long](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/c.long/index.html).

<!-- His research interests include **spatio-temporal data mining**, **interpretable machine learning** and **urban computing**. In particular, he has passion in designing (1) interpretable and robust algorithms for mining spatio-temporal data and graph data and (2) models for learning from these data types for various applications such as transportation, hazardous chemicals, epidemic, etc. -->
