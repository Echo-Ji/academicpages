Jiahao JI is a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, China, supervised by Prof. [Jingyuan Wang](https://www.bigscity.com/jingyuan-wang/). In February 2021, he participated in the joint doctoral training program of JD Intelligent Cities Research, supervised by Prof. [Yu Zheng](http://urban-computing.com/yuzheng) and Dr. [Junbo Zhang](https://zhangjunbo.org/). He received his B.S from Beihang University in 2019. He will start another joint doctoral training program of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, supervised by Prof. [Cheng Long](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/c.long/index.html).

<!-- Jiahao JI is currently seeking for job opportunities in both academia and industry. If you are interested in my research or hiring me, please feel free to <u><a href="/contact">contact me</a></u>. -->

## Research Interests

His research interests include **spatio-temporal data mining**, **interpretable machine learning** and **urban computing**. In particular, he has passion in designing (1) interpretable and robust algorithms for mining spatio-temporal data and graph data and (2) models for learning from these data types for various applications such as transportation, hazardous chemicals, epidemic, etc.
